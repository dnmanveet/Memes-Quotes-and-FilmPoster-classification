Memes, Quotes, Film-Poster these three almost have similar characteristics and appear the same in many cases. So, I thought of making a try make the computer learn and detect and differenciate these three things.

This is model is trained with a [dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z-_qCbeAMQHv5WGelQKV0-sq8DTPB6xw) which built by my own from google images.

The dataset contains **2470 images** which include memes, quotes and film posters for **training** and the **validation** set consists of **617 images**.

**The model is rained using a pretrained model called the resent34.**

_Appropriatly using those I managed to get an accuracy of 93.5%_
The model perfectly predicts the memes,quotes and film posters.
